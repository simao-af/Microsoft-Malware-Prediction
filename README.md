# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction

This project was made with PySpark in Jupyter Notebook.

Nowadays, with the rapid evolution of technologies, there is a much greater use of electronic devices connected to networks, constantly generating data. Due to this, there is also a greater concern for device and data security.

When a computer is infected with malware, the perpetrators of that malware can cause a lot of damage, not so much to individuals, but rather to large companies. With over one billion customers, including large enterprises, Microsoft invests time and money in trying to prevent and address this security issue.

As one of the combat strategies, Microsoft issued a challenge to the Data Science community in 2019 to predict whether a device would be infected with malware in the near future. For this purpose, they organized a competition on Kaggle, providing a very extensive and comprehensive database, and encouraged the Data Science community to build a model for predicting malware occurrences on devices.

This project aims to predict the probability of a Windows device being infected with malware based on different properties of that device. These properties, as well as device infections, were generated through a combination of the heartbeat (a program that runs specific scripts automatically when the system starts or restarts) and threat reports collected by the Windows system and Windows Defender protection.

According to Microsoft and Kaggle, the methodology used to create this dataset was designed to meet various constraints imposed by companies, not only in terms of privacy but also regarding the periods in which the device was active. Additionally, these data are not representative of Microsoft customer devices since the sample aims to include a much higher proportion of devices with malware.
